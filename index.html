  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Many modern buildings waste large amounts of energy due to inefficient
    heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This project
    aims to design and test a small-scale airflow control system that reduces
    power consumption while maintaining comfortable temperatures. By improving
    airflow dynamics and system efficiency, this project seeks to lower energy
    costs and reduce environmental impact.
