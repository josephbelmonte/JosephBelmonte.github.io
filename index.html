  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Many modern buildings waste large amounts of energy due to inefficient
    heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This project
    aims to design and test a small-scale airflow control system that reduces
    power consumption while maintaining comfortable temperatures. By improving
    airflow dynamics and system efficiency, this project seeks to lower energy
    costs and reduce environmental impact.

      The PDF above contains three concept sketches of the small-scale HVAC airflow control system,
      including the system layout, airflow sensors, and control interface.
